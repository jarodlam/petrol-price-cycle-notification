# Petrol price cycle notification
A Google Apps Script that checks the ACCC's petrol price cycles website and sends an email notification if the price cycle stage has changed.

I use this to remind myself to fill up my car when petrol prices are at the bottom of the cycle. It is set up in Google Apps Script to run once every hour.

The data is scraped from the [ACCC petrol price cycles website](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/petrol-diesel-lpg/petrol-price-cycles#petrol-prices-in-brisbane).
